# WP Domain Discovery

A few notes around domain discovery of Project Eudaimonia:
- Keeping in translated sites for two reasons: (1) keeping in content helps WP: translated sites may have different content which may be inaccessible; (2) keeping in content helps Equalify: the more data, the better we can tune our systems!
- Allowing externally hosted sites for now. Eg: sites like https://wordpress.github.io/wordpress-playground/
- We'll both crawl and sitemap scan sites, as per [Matt's request](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02QB8GMM/p1709906367907669?thread_ts=1709592171.733369&cid=C02QB8GMM)
