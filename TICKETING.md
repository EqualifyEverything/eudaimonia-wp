## Ticketing 
This document contains information about how we create tickets from Equalify issues.

### Process
Here is the current process of creating tickets, which we hope to automate further:
1. Run scan using [Equalify Version 1 - Release Candidate ](https://github.com/EqualifyEverything/equalify/tree/v1-rc5)5.
2. Find issues using the common queries available at [REPORTING.md](https://github.com/EqualifyEverything/eudaimonia-wp/blob/main/REPORTING.md).
3. Focus on critical issues. We've started to determine critical issues based on messages on [this Google Spreadsheet (linked)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pKDGP6-lHG85aYELv7Rk7hkfxQvF81ki8Vssq_w3GS0/edit?usp=sharing)
4. Generate additional reports that include all nodes and URLs related to critical issues.
5. Pass report to [Open AI Web Accessibility Helper GPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-nq8NGXebN-equalify-web-accessibility-helper).
6. Validate tickets.
7. Post tickets.
