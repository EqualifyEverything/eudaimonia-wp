## Project Eudaimonia
Project Eudaimonia is [Equalify](http://equalify.app)'s project to make [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) more accessible for people with disabilities.

## Need your WordPress "DotOrg" website Scanned?
We run automated scans of websites then create useful GitHub tickets of issues we think you should focus on.

To get your website scanned, ping the [accessibilty-testing](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/CEKKABGJD) channel in the Making WordPress Slack. More info on the Making WordPress Slack is available here: https://make.wordpress.org/contribute/join/

## websites.csv
[websites.csv](https://github.com/EqualifyEverything/eudaimonia-wp/blob/main/websites.csv) is document where we keep track of sites we scan. Any unscanned or priority sites are scanned each time we run our automated web accessibility scans.
