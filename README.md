## Project Eudaimonia
Project Eudaimonia is [Equalify](http://equalify.app)'s project to make [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) more accessible for people with disabilities. We run automated scans of WordPress properties, validate issues, and then create GitHub tickets to help developers solve accessibility problems.

## Need your WordPress "DotOrg" website Scanned?
We run automated scans of websites and then create useful GitHub tickets of issues you should focus on.

To get your website scanned, create a Pull Request to update [websites.csv](https://github.com/EqualifyEverything/eudaimonia-wp/blob/main/websites.csv. You can also ping the [accessibilty-testing](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/CEKKABGJD) channel in the Making WordPress Slack. More info on the Making WordPress Slack is available here: https://make.wordpress.org/contribute/join/

## Repo Contents
Here's an overview of the documents in this repo:
- **[websites.csv](https://github.com/EqualifyEverything/eudaimonia-wp/blob/main/websites.csv)** is where we keep track of sites we scan. Any unscanned or priority sites are scanned each time we run our automated web accessibility scans.
- **[equalify_db.sql.gz](https://github.com/EqualifyEverything/eudaimonia-wp/blob/main/equalify_db.sql.gz)** contains the latest output of data related to scans.
- **[REPORTING.md](https://github.com/EqualifyEverything/eudaimonia-wp/blob/main/REPORTING.md)** contains commonly used MySQL queries to parse the equalify data.
