## Project Eudaimonia
This is the repo for Project Eudaimonia.

Project Eudaimonia is [Equalify](http://equalify.app)'s project to make [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) accessible.

The project lead is [@bbertucc](https://github.com/bbertucc).

This project isn't _just_ about making the web more accessible to people with disabilities.

Accessibility projects, like [curb cuts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curb_cut), make everyone's life better.

Feel free to [create a new issue](https://github.com/EqualifyEverything/eudaimonia-wp/issues/new) with any questions.
